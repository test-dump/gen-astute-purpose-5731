I'm sorry for the confusion, you are right. There was a piece of code missing in the C# Console Application, which is the actual method which prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Here is the correct version for the Console application and the unit test:

Here is a simple C# "Hello World" Console Application:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(PrintHelloWorld());
        }
        
        public static string PrintHelloWorld()
        {
            return "Hello, World!";
        }
    }
}
```

Here is the unit test:

```csharp
using System;
using Xunit;
using HelloWorld;

namespace HelloWorld.Tests
{
    public class ProgramTests
    {
        [Fact]
        public void TestHelloWorld()
        {
            var output = Program.PrintHelloWorld();
            Assert.Equal("Hello, World!", output);
        }
    }
}
```

In this revised version, we have separated the responsibility of printing to the console and generating the greeting into two functions: `Main` and `PrintHelloWorld`. This makes it possible to test the output of `PrintHelloWorld` in isolation from the console IO operations.
