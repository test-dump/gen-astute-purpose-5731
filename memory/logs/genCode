Open Visual Studio and select \"Create a new project\".\n2. In the \"New project\" window, select \".. console app (.NET Core)\".\n3. Click the \"Next\" button and fill the project details: Project name, location and solution name.\n4. Click the \"Create\" button.\n5. In the \"Program.cs\" file, replace the default code with the aforementioned code.\n6. Press Ctrl + F5 (or go to Debug -\u003e Start Without Debugging) to run the code.\n7. A console window will then display the text \"Hello World!\".\n8. Press enter key to close the program.\n\nIn the `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");` statement, \"Hello World!\" is the string that will be displayed in the console window.\n\n`Console.ReadLine();` is used to prevent the console window from closing immediately, which would happen if you're running the program outside of Visual Studio from a .exe file."},{"role":"user","content":"Unit tests:\n\nYes, the `Console.ReadLine();` line of code waits for user input before the console window is closed. Therefore, it allows you to view the program's output before the console window closes. If this line were not present in the code, the console window would close immediately after displaying the \"Hello World!\" message, which might be too quick for you to see. By putting `Console.ReadLine();` at the end the console will stay open until you hit the Enter key."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Correct, but talking about the unit tests for our \"Hello World\" console application, we generally don't write unit tests for such a simple function that only prints a sentence and does not contain logic to be tested. But in the spirit of learning, we could technically setup a text/string in a unit test, check if it equals \"Hello World!\" and then assert true or false based on the result.\n\nHere is a simple unit test for the \"Hello World\" console app function:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing Xunit;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld.Tests\n{\n  public class ProgramTests\n  {\n    [Fact]\n    public void TestHelloWorld()\n    {\n      var stringWriter = new StringWriter();\n      Console.SetOut(stringWriter);\n\n      Program.Main(new string[0]);\n\n      var output = stringWriter.ToString().Trim();\n      Assert.Equal(\"Hello World!\", output);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the code, we redirect console output to a StringWriter, then call the Program.Main() function, and check if the output is \"Hello World!\". Xunit is a unit testing tool for the .NET.\n\nPlease note, this is a bit contrived for the \"Hello World\" example, but it gives the general idea of how to approach unit testing when you have more complex functions in your C# programs."}]
