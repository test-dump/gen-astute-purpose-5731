Below is a simple code example of a "Hello World" console application in C#:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
       Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
       Console.ReadLine();
    }
  }
}
```
You can use this code to create a "Hello World" console application. 

Here is the steps: 
1. Open Visual Studio and select "Create a new project".
2. In the "New project" window, select ".. console app (.NET Core)".
3. Click the "Next" button and fill the project details: Project name, location and solution name.
4. Click the "Create" button.
5. In the "Program.cs" file, replace the default code with the aforementioned code.
6. Press Ctrl + F5 (or go to Debug -> Start Without Debugging) to run the code.
7. A console window will then display the text "Hello World!".
8. Press enter key to close the program.

In the `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` statement, "Hello World!" is the string that will be displayed in the console window.

`Console.ReadLine();` is used to prevent the console window from closing immediately, which would happen if you're running the program outside of Visual Studio from a .exe file.
