Yes, the `Console.ReadLine();` line of code waits for user input before the console window is closed. Therefore, it allows you to view the program's output before the console window closes. If this line were not present in the code, the console window would close immediately after displaying the "Hello World!" message, which might be too quick for you to see. By putting `Console.ReadLine();` at the end the console will stay open until you hit the Enter key.
